        <h1>Food</h1>
    Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an
    organism.<br />
    Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential
    nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.<br />
    The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's
    cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. <br />Different
    species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs
    of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological
    niche within specific geographical contexts.<br />
    Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in
    many different ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two
    main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. <br />As agricultural
    technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with
    diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography.<br />
    Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines
    and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices,
    techniques, and dishes. <br />As cultures have mixed through forces like
    international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely
    available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a
    cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices.<br />
